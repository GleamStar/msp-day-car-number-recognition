 ##### This the base app for car number recognition which base on openalpr library + Azure Computer Vision .   
 The main problem of the app is that we have ability to recognize car numbers only in ideal conditions but in other way if openalpr is worked we will get a couple of objects which can be target car number and in this way we don't have solution for now.  
 The solution of the problem could be creating some neural networks which base on car plate dataset to choose target number.
